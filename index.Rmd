# What are emotions?

> Emotions as **core affect**: Short-lived psychological states that consume the individual's energy and strongly influence cognition and behavior, for example expression.

Emotional or affective behavior of an individual takes place at various timescales:

![](figures/emotionscale.png)
- Reflex reactions: fast physiological responses  
- Core affect: relax quickly and are triggered by a stimulus
- Mood: slow-changing and constant emotional state 
- Personality traits are lifelong behavior patterns, some about emotions

---

# Computational Affective Science

> **Affective Science** is the (interdisciplinary) scientific study of emotions. 

> **Computational Affective Science** applies methods from Computer Science and Data Science to Affective Science. 

Some examples are affective computing, cyberpsychology of affect, emotion recognition, and sentiment analysis.

# Measuring emotions

Emotions can be measured through various signals and observable behaviors:

![](figures/measurement.png)

In the following, we are going to cover four models of how to capture emotions in quantitative research. Some approaches are better for some modes or signals (e.g. text, facial expression) than others.

---

# Ekman's basic emotions model

.center[![:scale 48%](figures/ekman.png)]
Developed by **Paul Ekman** to classify facial expression of emotions. 
---

# Plutchik's wheel of emotions
.center[![:scale 47%](figures/Wheel.png)]

---

# The circumplex model of affect

.center[![:scale 47%](figures/circumplex.svg)]

---

# Dimensions in the circumplex model


> **Valence:** the degree of pleasure experienced in an emotion  
  
- Explains the most variance from positive/pleasant to negative/unpleasant
- It can be measured physiologically with smiling and frowning muscle activity
- It is the most common dimension of emotions included in text analysis  

> **Arousal:** the level of activity associated with an emotion  

- Explains less variance than valence but it is informative to differentiate emotions  
- It can be measured with skin conductance and heart rate sensors  
- Not so common in text analysis but can be estimated from voice tone  

Extensions include other dimensions: dominance and surprise
---

# Positive And Negative Affect Schedule

.center[![:scale 55%](figures/PANAS2.jpg)]

Two simultaneous dimensions of Positive Affect and Negative Affect (PANAS).  
Commonly known as the *mood* model.

## *Computational* in Computational Social Science
It can have three meanings:

- **Digital**<br> 
Based on large datasets of human behavior, for example produced by the Web and social media

- **Computerized**<br>
The quantitative analysis of data in an automated, tractable, repeatable, and extensible fashion

- **Generative**<br>
Application of data and results to design of agent-based models that explain complex social phenomena and motivate interventions

## Strengths and weaknesses of digital trace data

**Strengths:**
- Complementary approach to traditional survey and experimental methods
- Unprecedented scales and granularities
- Ease of data access, replicability of results
- Potentially high external validity, behavior in vivo

**Weaknesses:**
- Limits to internal validity: Lack of counterfactuals hinders causal analysis
- Self-selection bias: Who talks? Normalization issues: Who is silent?
- Data gatekeepers, Twitter as a model organism
- Intractability of black-box predictions and data piñatas

# Conclusions of Paris attacks study

- Terrorist attacks trigger collective emotions that we can observe online

- Terms related to social resilience increase after collective emotions

- Individuals expressing stronger emotions used on average more terms related to social processes, prosocial behavior, and shared values

- Collective emotions are not just venting, they can keep us together

- Negative effects: inter-group conflict, intolerance, short-term orientation...

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=500, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Cyberemotions.png")
```

- Horizontal: agent design
  - $v$, $a$: internal valence and arousal emotional state of the agent
  - $s$: visible emotional expression as measured (e.g. pos/neg/neu)
- Vertical: interaction between agents
  - $h$ is a communication field averaging recent expression of agents
  - Agent's emotions change with time and the value of $h$
---

# Valence and arousal dynamics

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=900, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Dynamics1.png")
```

- $b,d$: baselines of valence and arousal
- $\gamma_v$, $\gamma_a$: relaxation tendency of valence and arousal towards baselines
- $\xi_v$, $\xi_a$: stochastic components of valence and arousal dynamics

[The dynamics of emotions in online interaction. David Garcia, Arvid Kappas, Dennis Küster and Frank Schweitzer. Royal Society Open Science (2016)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.160059)

# Examples of field influence functions

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=1000, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/Dynamics2.png")
```

- Field influence functions as products of a polynomial of valence and arousal

- Approximation to some unknown function to fit empirically

- Valence depends on $h$ (pos/neg) and arousal on $|h|$ (absolute value)

---

# Activation function

$$\large s_i(t) = f_s(v_i(t)) \Theta [a_i(t) - \tau_i]$$
- $s_i(t)$ is the visible emotional expression of agent $i$ aggregated in field $h$

- $f_s(v)$ is a function of how valence is expressed through text
  - For example only sign or an approximation of internal valence

- $\tau_i$ is agent $i$'s arousal threshold to expression

- $\Theta[x]$ is the Heaviside step function: it has value 1 if $x>0$, and 0 otherwise

- After expression: reset of arousal to baseline ( $a_i(t) \leftarrow d$ )

# Expression trigger and effects

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width=900, fig.align='center'}

- Probability to participate is flat up to a threshold of arousal, then it grows
- Effect of expression of arousal is a linear approach to baseline, not a reset
